"""
UTF-8 safe stream decoder for handling incomplete multi-byte sequences.

This module provides utilities for safely decoding UTF-8 byte streams where
chunks may split multi-byte characters across packet boundaries.

    A stateful UTF-8 stream decoder that handles incomplete multi-byte sequences.

    When network data is chunked, UTF-8 multi-byte characters may be split across
    chunks. This decoder buffers incomplete sequences and combines them with the
    next chunk for proper decoding.

    Example:
        >>> decoder = StreamDecoder()
        >>> text, complete = decoder.decode(b"Hello \\xe4\\xb8")  # Incomplete Chinese char
        >>> print(text)  # "Hello "
